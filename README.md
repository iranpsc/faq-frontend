## FAQ Q&A Platform (Laravel + Vue 3)

A modern, RTL-friendly Q&A platform where users can ask questions, answer, comment, vote, and curate content. It features role/level-based moderation, OAuth login, and a Vue 3 SPA frontend powered by TailwindCSS and Vite.

### Key Features
- **Questions**: create, read, update, delete; tag with multiple tags; belong to a category; auto-slugging; view counters; pagination
- **Answers**: reply to questions; publish moderation; mark correctness by higher-level users; sorting by votes, comments, recency
- **Comments**: on questions and answers; publish moderation; voting
- **Voting**: up/down votes on questions, answers, and comments; real-time counts returned by API
- **Publishing workflow**: higher-level users can publish content of lower-level users; some high-level users auto-publish their own questions
- **Pin/Feature**: users can pin questions for themselves; authorized users can feature/unfeature
- **Search & Filtering**: full-text search by title, filters for category/tags/solved/unanswered; sort by created date, votes, answers, views
- **Dashboards**: recommended and popular questions, daily activity feed, active users, global stats
- **OAuth + API tokens**: external OAuth for login, then Laravel Sanctum bearer token for API
- **Notifications**: queued email notifications to question owners upon answers and comments
- **Persian/RTL**: RTL layout, Persian text strings, right-to-left UI and date support

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Laravel 12, PHP 8.2, Laravel Sanctum 4.x, Laravel Notifications/Queues, Eloquent ORM
- **Frontend**: Vue 3, Vue Router 4, TailwindCSS 3, Vite 6, Axios, NProgress, SweetAlert2, PrimeVue (and related themes), Select2, TinyMCE Vue integration
- **Database**: Laravel-supported drivers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.)
- **Testing**: PHPUnit 11, Laravel Test utilities, Faker
- **Utilities**: `sadegh19b/laravel-persian-validation` for Persian validation messages

### High-level Architecture
- SPA served from `resources/views/app.blade.php` with `@vite` assets; any web path is handled by a catch-all route and rendered by Vue Router
- RESTful API under `/api/*` serving JSON resources with dedicated controllers and policies
- Vue 3 app manages routes, auth state, modals, and global loading with NProgress; Axios adds bearer token automatically
- Queue workers deliver email notifications asynchronously

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for local/dev)

### Setup
1. Install PHP dependencies:
   - `composer install`
2. Install JS dependencies:
   - `npm install`
3. Environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure database and app URLs
   - Set OAuth and mail variables (see below)
4. Generate app key:
   - `php artisan key:generate`
5. Migrate (and optionally seed):
   - `php artisan migrate`
   - Optional: `php artisan db:seed`
6. Storage symlink (for uploaded files):
   - `php artisan storage:link`

### Running in development
- One-shot dev (runs server, queue, logs, Vite) using concurrently:
  - `composer run dev`

Or run individually in separate terminals:
- PHP server: `php artisan serve`
- Queue worker: `php artisan queue:listen --tries=1`
- Logs: `php artisan pail --timeout=0`
- Vite: `npm run dev`

### Production notes
- Run a persistent queue worker (e.g., Supervisor) to process notifications
- Configure mail provider and `QUEUE_CONNECTION`
- Serve built assets: `npm run build`

## Authentication Flow
The app uses an external OAuth provider for login, then issues a Laravel Sanctum personal access token for API calls.

1. Frontend requests `GET /api/auth/redirect`
2. Backend returns OAuth authorization URL; browser is redirected to the OAuth server
3. After user authorization, OAuth provider redirects to `GET /api/auth/callback`
4. Backend exchanges code for access token, fetches user info, signs user in, and redirects back to the SPA with a query param `?token=...`
5. Frontend stores `auth_token` in `localStorage` and attaches it to subsequent API requests via Axios

Configure in `config/services.php` using environment variables:
- `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OAUTH_SERVER_URL` (e.g., `https://accounts.example.com`)
- `APP_URL` (used for redirect and return)

## Roles, Levels, and Permissions
- **User.level**: numeric level that governs moderation powers
  - Higher-level users can publish content of lower-level users
  - Users with level ≥ 3 auto-publish their own questions
- **User.role**: `admin` can bypass certain restrictions (e.g., delete any question/answer)

Authorization is enforced via policies and controller `authorize` calls; routes requiring auth use `auth:sanctum`. Some list/show endpoints accept optional auth via custom `auth.optional` middleware to tailor visibility.

## Scoring System (Gamification)
- Create answer: **+5** to answer owner
- Create comment: **+2** to comment owner
- Publish question: **+2** to publisher
- Publish answer: **+3** to publisher
- Upvote received on question/answer: **+10** to content owner
- Downvote received on question/answer: **-2** to content owner
- Toggle answer correctness by qualified marker:
  - Mark correct: **+10** to answer owner, **+2** to marker
  - Unmark correct: **-10** to answer owner, **+2** to marker
- First-time email verification update: **+10** to the user

## API Overview

Base URL: `/api`

### Auth
- `GET /auth/redirect` → returns OAuth authorization URL
- `GET /auth/callback` → OAuth callback; redirects to app with `?token=`
- `GET /auth/me` → current user (auth)
- `POST /auth/logout` → revoke tokens (auth)

### Questions
- `GET /questions` → list with filters, sorting, pagination
- `GET /questions/search?q=...&limit=...` → search published questions
- `GET /questions/recommended` → recommended questions
- `GET /questions/popular?period=week|month|year|all` → popular questions
- `GET /questions/{slug}` → show (increments views)
- `POST /questions` → create (auth)
- `PUT /questions/{id}` → update (owner/moderator)
- `DELETE /questions/{id}` → delete (owner/admin)
- `POST /questions/{id}/publish` → publish (higher-level user)
- `POST /questions/{id}/vote` → vote `{ type: up|down }` (auth)
- `POST /questions/{id}/pin` / `DELETE /questions/{id}/pin` → pin/unpin for current user (auth)
- `POST /questions/{id}/feature` / `DELETE /questions/{id}/feature` → feature/unfeature (authorized)

### Answers
- `GET /questions/{id}/answers` → list (visible to user based on auth/level)
- `POST /questions/{id}/answers` → create (auth)
- `PUT /answers/{id}` → update (owner)
- `DELETE /answers/{id}` → delete (owner/admin)
- `POST /answers/{id}/publish` → publish (higher-level user)
- `POST /answers/{id}/vote` → vote `{ type: up|down }` (auth)
- `POST /answers/{id}/toggle-correctness` → toggle correctness (level ≥ 4 and not the owner; precedence to highest-level marks)

### Comments
- `GET /questions/{id}/comments` and `GET /answers/{id}/comments` → list
- `POST /questions/{id}/comments` and `POST /answers/{id}/comments` → create (auth)
- `PUT /comments/{id}` → update (owner)
- `DELETE /comments/{id}` → delete (owner/admin)
- `POST /comments/{id}/publish` → publish (authorized)
- `POST /comments/{id}/vote` → vote `{ type: up|down }` (auth)

### Categories & Tags
- `GET /categories` and `GET /categories/{slug}`
- `GET /categories/popular`
- `GET /categories/{slug}/questions`
- `GET /tags` and `GET /tags/{slug}/questions`

### Authors & Users
- `GET /authors` and `GET /authors/{id}`
- `GET /user/profile` / `GET /user/stats` / `GET /user/activity` (auth)
- `POST /user/update-image` (auth)

### File Uploads (auth)
- `POST /upload/tinymce-image` → TinyMCE image
- `POST /upload/file` → generic file
- `DELETE /upload/file` → delete

### Example: Authenticated request
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <SANCTUM_TOKEN>" -H "Accept: application/json" \
  https://your-app.test/api/questions
```

## Search and Filtering
`GET /api/questions` accepts rich parameters:
- **Filtering**: `category_id`, `tags` (comma-separated tag IDs), `filter` in `unanswered|unsolved|solved`
- **Sorting**: `sort=created_at|votes|answers_count|views_count` with `order=asc|desc`
- Legacy params still supported: `newest`, `oldest`, `most_votes`, `most_answers`, `most_views`, `unanswered`, `unsolved`

## Frontend Overview
- **SPA routing**: `/` home, `/questions/:slug`, `/authors`, `/authors/:id`, `/categories`, `/categories/:slug`, `/tags`, `/tags/:slug`, `/profile` (requires auth), `/activities`
- **Auth UX**: when a protected route is hit without a token, the app calls `/api/auth/redirect` and navigates to OAuth
- **Dark mode**: Tailwind `darkMode: 'class'`, theme toggles via composable
- **Global services**: Axios instance (`resources/js/services/api.js`), and an in-app `questionService` event bus

## Notifications & Queues
- Email notifications are sent to question owners on answers and comments (`App\Notifications\QuestionInteractionNotification`)
- Notifications implement `ShouldQueue` → ensure a queue worker is running
- Configure mailer in `.env` (`MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_HOST`, etc.)

## Tests
- Run: `composer test`
- Feature tests cover: questions CRUD, search/filter, visibility scopes; answers CRUD, publishing, voting; comments CRUD; correctness marking workflow and quotas; policies and scoring effects
